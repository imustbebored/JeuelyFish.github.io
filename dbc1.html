<h2> How do I prounce your first name?! It's weird! </h2>
<p> Yeah, it is kinda weird huh? I blame my parents. It's pronounced like the word <strong>"jew"</strong> in the word <em>"jewish"</em> and <strong>"el"</strong> like you are saying the name of the letter <em>"L"</em>. You can call me whatever you feel comfortable with.</p>
<h3>Oh, I see! What are your hobbies?</h3>
<p> I do a lot of nerdy things and some not-so-nerdy-things! Here is an unordered list of them. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Dungeons N Dragons</li>
	<li>Playing Music</li>
	<li>Playing Videogames (especially Star-Craft)</li>
	<li>Reading, talking about, and teaching Philosophy</li>
</ul>
